- **Spark Effects**: CSS animations with JavaScript particle system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layouts for all new elements
- **Security**: Maintained CSP headers across all pages
- **Server Architecture**: Express.js with proper middleware ordering
- **File Storage**: Multer + crypto for unique filenames, 50MB limit
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for image upload/download/delete operations
- **CORS Configuration**: Enabled for local development and cross-origin requests
- **Client-Side Caching**: localStorage for instant settings/checklist/notes loading
- **Smart Syncing**: Background server sync after instant local updates
- **Performance**: Zero-delay page loads with early settings application
- **Instant Rendering**: All UI elements (checklist, notes, settings) render before server response

### Design Philosophy Applied
- **KISS Principle**: Kept styling simple and effective
- **DOTI Approach**: Avoided overthinking complex animations
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Glass-morphism with subtle effects
- **Consistency**: Unified design language across all pages
