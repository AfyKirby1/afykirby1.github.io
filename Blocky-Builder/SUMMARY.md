# Blocky Builder - Project Summary

## Overview
Blocky Builder is a standalone visual world editor for creating custom game worlds using a tile-based system. Built as a single-file HTML application with no dependencies, it provides an intuitive interface for designing game levels and exporting them to JSON format.

- ✅ **Draggable NPC Builder Panel** - Smooth drag functionality with GPU acceleration
- ✅ **Persistent NPC Storage** - Hybrid localStorage + file system for GitHub Pages
- ✅ **NPC Template Management** - Custom NPC templates with deletion and cleanup
- ✅ **GitHub Pages Integration** - Deployment script and persistent folder structure
- ✅ **Building System** - Complete building placement, management, and rendering system
- ✅ **Texture-Based Buildings** - Upload PNG textures and place them as buildings
- ✅ **Building Manager UI** - Dedicated panel with drag functionality and template management
- ✅ **Building Persistence** - Buildings saved to localStorage and integrated with world system
- ✅ **Coordinate System Fixes** - Buildings place exactly where you click (zoom-aware)
- ✅ **Building Rendering Pipeline** - Efficient texture loading and caching system

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Canvas:** HTML5 Canvas API for rendering
- **Storage:** LocalStorage for persistence
- **Assets:** PNG texture support with fallback colors

### Default Textures Included
- Ground_Texture_1.png (Grass)
- Water_Texture.png (Water)
- Cave_Texture_1.png (Cave/Wall)

```

## How It Works

1. **Loading:** Open `world-editor.html` in any modern browser
2. **Editing:** Select tiles from palette, use tools to paint world
3. **Customizing:** Add custom tiles via PNG upload with auto-color detection
4. **Exporting:** Save world as JSON for use in game engine
5. **Importing:** Load previously saved worlds or tile sets

## Export Format
JSON structure with metadata, world dimensions, and tile array containing position, type, color, rotation, and flip state for each tile.

## Next Steps / Roadmap
- [ ] Add layer support for multi-level worlds
- [ ] Selection tools (rectangle, magic wand)
- [ ] Copy/paste functionality
- [ ] Tile search and filtering
- [ ] Advanced brush shapes (circle, line)
- [ ] World templates and presets

## Known Issues
None currently identified.

## Performance Notes
- Optimized for worlds up to 500x500 tiles
- Textures cached after first load
- Grid auto-hides when zoomed out for better performance
