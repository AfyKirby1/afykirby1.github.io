# Blocky Builder - Recent Updates

## 🚀 Latest Fix - January 27, 2025
**NPC Visual Rendering Fix**

### 🎨 **Issue Resolved**
- **Problem**: NPCs were displaying as simple circles ("little bubbles") instead of proper sprites
- **Root Cause**: Main game renderer was using basic circle rendering instead of the advanced sprite system from NPC Builder
- **Solution**: Integrated NPC Builder's sprite rendering system with main game renderer

### 🔧 **Technical Changes**
- **Updated Renderer.js**: Replaced simple circle rendering with proper sprite system
- **Added Sprite Cache**: Implemented NPC sprite caching system for performance
- **Custom Image Support**: Now properly renders uploaded custom NPC images
- **Fallback System**: Graceful fallback to default NPC sprites if custom images fail to load

### 🎯 **Visual Improvements**
- **Default NPCs**: Now display as proper sprites with faces, eyes, and colored bodies
- **Custom NPCs**: Uploaded PNG images now render correctly in the game
- **Visual Indicators**: Custom NPCs show golden stripe indicator when sprite is loading
- **Better Names**: NPC names display clearly above sprites

### 📊 **Performance Enhancements**
- **Sprite Caching**: Custom images are cached to prevent repeated loading
- **Async Loading**: Non-blocking image loading with proper error handling
- **Memory Management**: Efficient sprite cache management
