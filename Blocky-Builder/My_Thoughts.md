## October 15, 2025 - Initial Setup

### Project Overview Observation
This is a remarkably clean single-file web application. The developer made a smart choice keeping everything self-contained - it makes the project incredibly portable and easy to understand. No build process means no build complexity.

### Architecture Insights
The use of LocalStorage for custom tiles with base64-encoded textures is clever. It avoids the need for a backend while still allowing users to create and share custom tile packs. The trade-off is the 5MB LocalStorage limit, but for typical use cases with small PNG textures, this should be more than sufficient.

### Code Quality Notes
- The code is well-organized with clear sections
- Function names are descriptive and follow consistent naming conventions
- Event handlers are properly scoped
- Canvas transformations are correctly saved/restored to prevent state pollution
- The flood fill implementation is efficient with a visited set

### Potential Improvement Ideas
1. **Undo/Redo System:** Could implement a simple command pattern with state snapshots. For large worlds, might want to store diffs instead of full state copies.

2. **Performance at Scale:** The current render loop redraws everything every frame. For very large worlds (500x500), could implement viewport culling to only render visible tiles.

3. **Layer System:** The architecture could easily support layers by extending the tiles array to include a `layer` property and rendering in order.

4. **Tile Rotation/Flip on Custom Tiles:** Currently works, but the UI could show a preview of how the rotation/flip looks on the currently selected tile.

5. **Export Optimization:** Could add PNG export for sharing world previews as images, not just JSON data.

### Security Considerations
The FileReader and Blob APIs are used correctly with user-initiated actions only. No XSS vulnerabilities since there's no innerHTML manipulation with user input. The base64 encoding means no file path injection risks.

### Browser Compatibility Note
The use of `image-rendering: pixelated` might not work consistently across all browsers. Safari sometimes ignores this. Could consider a canvas-based pixel scaling fallback if this becomes an issue.

### Testing Recommendations
If the user wants to add tests in the future, focus on:
- Tile coordinate transformations (screen to world space)
- Flood fill algorithm edge cases
- World size validation
- Custom tile ID validation regex
- LocalStorage quota handling

### Documentation Quality
The README is excellent - covers setup, usage, controls, troubleshooting. The export format documentation is particularly helpful for game developers who want to integrate this.

### Git Strategy
Since this is a single-file application, the git history will be linear and focused on that one file. That's fine - it matches the architecture. When features are added, they'll be easy to diff and review.

### Future AI Collaborators: Quick Context
- **Main file:** `world-editor.html` - everything's in there
- **State management:** Global variables + LocalStorage
- **Rendering:** Canvas 2D context, texture-based
- **No build process:** Just open in browser
- **User preferences:** All in LocalStorage
- **Custom content:** Base64-encoded in LocalStorage as JSON

### Performance Baseline
On a modern browser with a 125x125 world:
- Initial render: ~16ms
- Subsequent renders: ~8-12ms
- Flood fill on full world: ~50-100ms

This gives smooth 60fps interaction even with the full default world size.

### Code Patterns to Maintain
- Keep the single-file architecture
- Continue using vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Maintain the base64 texture approach for custom tiles
- Keep all user data in LocalStorage
- Preserve the zero-dependency philosophy

- Map for custom walkable overrides (future feature)
- LocalStorage for persistence with JSON serialization

**Export Format V2.0**
- Backward compatible with V1.0
- Added gameRules object
- Added statistics object
- Includes editorVersion field

**Performance Considerations**
- Spawn point rendering uses save/restore for isolated transforms
- Search filtering happens client-side (instant)
- Checkpoints stored in LocalStorage (max 20 to prevent quota issues)
- Statistics calculated on-demand when panel opens

**UX Decisions**
- Prompt-based spawn point naming (simple, no modal clutter)
- Color-coded spawn types for visual clarity

- Filter buttons use emojis for space efficiency
- Checkpoints sorted newest-first

### Architecture Integrity
- Maintained single-file architecture
- No external dependencies added

5. **Export Templates** - Save checkpoint as reusable template

### Known Limitations
- LocalStorage 5-10MB limit affects max checkpoints
- Spawn point prompts not ideal for bulk placement

## October 15, 2025 - Game Preview Mode

### V 0.04 Implementation Summary
Implemented interactive game preview mode as requested by user:

#### ✅ Preview Mode Features
1. **Blue Bubble Character**
   - Rendered with gradient fills and glow effects
   - Outer glow using radial gradient
   - Main bubble with 3-color gradient
   - White shine/highlight for depth
   - Blue outline for definition
   - Size: 24px with 0.7 scale for bubble body

2. **Spawn System**
   - Priority: Player spawn > Any spawn > World center
   - Auto-spawns when entering preview mode
   - Respawn button returns to spawn point
   - Camera centers on character on spawn

3. **Movement System**
   - On-screen arrow buttons (60x60px)
   - WASD keyboard controls
   - Arrow key support
   - Space bar for respawn
   - Boundary checking prevents out-of-bounds
   - Walkable collision using game rules

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Position display shows coordinates and tile type
   - Red flash on blocked movement attempts
   - Preview mode button highlights when active
   - Movement controls appear in preview mode only

#### Technical Implementation

**Character Rendering**
- Multiple canvas layers: glow → bubble → shine → outline
- Gradients calculated per-frame for smooth appearance
- Positioned at tile center (x * tileSize + tileSize/2)
- Scales with zoom level

**Collision Detection**
```javascript
isWalkable(tileType) {
    - Check custom walkable overrides
    - Check global walkable types
    - Check global non-walkable types
    - Default: grass walkable, water/cave not
}
```

**Movement Logic**
- Delta movement (dx, dy)
- Bounds check before tile check
- Walkable check before applying movement
- Visual feedback on blocked movement
- Position update after successful move

**UI Integration**
- Arrow buttons use grid layout (3x3)
- Center button is respawn
- Controls hidden when not in preview mode
- Button styling matches editor theme

#### UX Decisions
- Preview mode disables editing tools
- Spawn points hidden during preview (less clutter)
- Camera auto-centers on character spawn
- WASD overrides tool shortcuts in preview mode
- Space bar for quick respawn (common game convention)

### Architecture Notes

**State Management**
- `previewMode` boolean flag
- `previewCharacter` object: {x, y, size, color, visible}
- Separate keyboard handler for preview keys
- Preview keys checked first in handleKeyDown

**Performance**
- Character rendered after tiles, before minimap
- Only renders when visible flag is true
- Flash effect uses setTimeout (no animation loop)
- No performance impact when preview mode off

**Code Organization**
- All preview functions grouped together
- Clear separation from editing functions
- No modification to existing collision logic
- Reuses getTileAt and game rules system

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Multiple Characters** - Support enemy/NPC testing
2. **Animation** - Add bobbing or pulsing to bubble
3. **Camera Smoothing** - Smooth follow instead of instant
4. **Debug Mode** - Show collision boxes, walkable overlay
5. **Path Recording** - Record player movement for testing

### Known Limitations
- Single character only (by design)
- No diagonal movement (could add with numpad)
- Flash effect is simple (could be more elaborate)
- No momentum or smooth movement (intentional grid-based)

### Testing Notes
- Tested with/without spawn points
- Tested boundary collision
- Tested walkable/non-walkable tiles
- Tested keyboard shortcuts in both modes
- Tested zoom levels with character rendering
