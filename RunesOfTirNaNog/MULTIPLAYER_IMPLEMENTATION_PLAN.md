- [x] Real-time position synchronization
- [ ] Basic chat system
- [x] Player list management
- [x] Connection status tracking

## 📋 Phase 2: Client-Side Network Layer

### 2.1 Network Manager (`core/NetworkManager.js`)
- [x] WebSocket client connection
- [x] Player state synchronization
- [x] Server communication protocol
- [x] Connection status handling
- [x] Reconnection logic

### 2.2 Player Synchronization
- [x] Modify `Player.js` to sync with server
- [x] Add other players rendering
- [x] Handle network lag compensation
- [x] Player name display for all players

## 📋 Phase 3: UI/UX Implementation

### 3.1 Username Input System
- [x] Add username input bar to main menu
- [x] Create username modal with validation
- [x] Store username in localStorage
- [x] Username display in game

### 3.2 Server Connection UI
- [x] "Join Server" button in main menu
- [x] Connection status indicator
- [x] Server selection (localhost for now)
- [x] Disconnect functionality
- [x] Automatic server detection

### 3.3 Menu Flow Integration
- [x] Landing page → Username input → Main menu → Join Server
- [x] Consistent styling with existing UI
- [x] Error handling and user feedback

## 📋 Phase 4: Game Integration

### 4.1 Multiplayer Game State
- [ ] Modify `Game.js` to handle multiple players
- [ ] Add player list management
- [ ] Implement basic collision detection
- [ ] Sync world state across players

### 4.2 Visual Enhancements
- [ ] Different colored players
- [ ] Player name tags for all players
- [ ] Connection status indicators
- [ ] Basic player animations sync

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Server Architecture
```python
# server.py structure
class GameServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.players = {}  # {player_id: {name, x, y, color}}
        self.game_state = {}
    
    async def handle_player(self, websocket, path):
        # Handle player connections
        # Sync player positions
        # Manage game state
```

### Client Network Layer
```javascript
// core/NetworkManager.js structure
class NetworkManager {
    constructor(game) {
        this.game = game;
        this.socket = null;
        this.playerId = null;
        this.otherPlayers = {};
    }
    
    connect(username) {
        // Connect to WebSocket server
        // Send player data
        // Handle incoming updates
    }
}
```

### UI Components
```html
<!-- Username input bar -->
<div class="username-bar">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter username" maxlength="20">
    <button class="set-username-btn">Set</button>
</div>

<!-- Join Server button -->
<button class="join-server-btn">
    <span class="icon">🌐</span>
    Join Server
</button>
```

## 📁 File Structure Changes

### New Files
- `core/NetworkManager.js` - WebSocket client
- `ui/UsernameModal.js` - Username input modal
- `ui/ServerStatus.js` - Connection status display
- `multiplayer/PlayerSync.js` - Player synchronization

### Modified Files
- `server.py` - Add WebSocket support
- `core/Game.js` - Integrate multiplayer
- `player/Player.js` - Add network sync
- `assets/menu.html` - Add username/join UI
- `landing.html` - Add username flow

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Styling Consistency
- [ ] Match existing golden glow theme
- [ ] Use same button styling as current menu
- [ ] Consistent color scheme (green for join, blue for settings)
- [ ] Rounded corners and subtle shadows

### User Experience
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for connection status
- [ ] Intuitive username validation
- [ ] Smooth transitions between states
- [ ] Error messages for connection issues

## 🚀 Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Server infrastructure and WebSocket setup
2. **Week 2**: Client network layer and basic sync
3. **Week 3**: UI components and menu integration ✅ **COMPLETED**
4. **Week 4**: Game integration and testing

## 📊 **Current Progress Status**

### ✅ **COMPLETED PHASES:**
- **Phase 3.1**: Username Input System ✅ **100% Complete**
- **Phase 3.2**: Server Connection UI ✅ **100% Complete**  
- **Phase 3.3**: Menu Flow Integration ✅ **100% Complete**

### 🔄 **NEXT PHASES:**
- **Phase 1**: Server Infrastructure (WebSocket setup)
- **Phase 2**: Client Network Layer (NetworkManager.js)
- **Phase 4**: Game Integration (Multiplayer game state)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Local Testing
- [ ] Multiple browser tabs for testing
- [ ] Username validation testing
- [ ] Connection/disconnection testing
- [ ] Position sync verification

### Performance Considerations
