## 🧪 Testing Health Bar

The health bar can be tested using browser console commands:

```javascript
// Set health levels
testHealth.setFull()    // 10/10 hearts
testHealth.setHalf()    // 5/10 hearts  
testHealth.setLow()     // 2/10 hearts
testHealth.setEmpty()   // 0/10 hearts

// Dynamic changes
testHealth.damage(2)    // Take 2 damage
testHealth.heal(1)      // Heal 1 health
```

## 🎨 Ground Texture System

The game now features a pixel art ground texture system:

- **Textured Tiles**: Ground tiles now use the `Ground_Texture_1.png` pixel art texture

## 🚀 Next Steps

This enhanced prototype establishes a solid foundation. Future phases will add:

1. **Multiplayer Server** - WebSocket server implementation for real-time multiplayer
2. **Player Synchronization** - Network layer for position and state sync
3. **Combat System** - Turn-based battles with health integration
4. **Quest System** - Story and objectives with UI integration
5. **Save System** - Progress persistence
6. **More Textures** - Additional tile types and environment variety
7. **NPCs** - Interactive characters with dialogue systems
8. **Enemies** - AI-controlled opponents with pathfinding

## 💡 Design Philosophy

- **Lightweight First**: Prove concepts work before adding complexity
- **Performance Focused**: 60 FPS target, minimal resource usage
- **Iterative Development**: Each phase adds one major system
- **Web Native**: Browser-only, no downloads required
