# Multiplayer Loading Screen Flicker Fix

## Issue Description
**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: Poor user experience during multiplayer connection

### Problem
When joining multiplayer servers, users experienced a brief moment of bare green screen with "funky buttons" before the loading screen appeared. This created a jarring transition and made the connection process feel unprofessional.

### Root Cause
The loading screen was only shown after the game initialization process began, but the game UI elements (canvas, controls, etc.) were visible immediately on page load. This created a visual gap where users could see the game interface before the loading screen covered it.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Immediate Loading Screen Display
**File**: `index.html`  
**Location**: Head script section

```javascript
<script>
    (function() {
        try {
            var params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
            if (params.get('multiplayer') === 'true') {
                document.documentElement.classList.add('is-connecting');
            }
        } catch (e) {}
    })();
</script>
```

**Purpose**: Detect multiplayer mode immediately and apply CSS class to show loading screen before any game UI renders.

### 2. CSS Loading State
**File**: `index.html`  
**Location**: CSS section

```css
/* Show loading immediately when multiplayer param is present */
html.is-connecting .loading-screen {
    display: flex;
}

/* Hide gameplay while connecting */
html.is-connecting .game-container {
    opacity: 0;
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

**Purpose**: Hide game UI elements and show loading screen immediately when multiplayer mode is detected.

### 3. LoadingScreenManager Integration
**File**: `index.html`  
**Location**: LoadingScreenManager class

```javascript
show() {
    // Hide game UI elements immediately
    if (this.gameContainer) {
        this.gameContainer.classList.add('loading');
    }
    
    // Show loading screen
    this.loadingScreen.classList.add('show');
    this.isVisible = true;
    this.startProgressSimulation();
}

hide() {
    // Hide loading screen
    this.loadingScreen.classList.remove('show');
    this.isVisible = false;
    this.resetProgress();
    
    // Show game UI elements
    if (this.gameContainer) {
        this.gameContainer.classList.remove('loading');
    }
}
```

**Purpose**: Coordinate loading screen display with game UI hiding/showing.

## Technical Details
